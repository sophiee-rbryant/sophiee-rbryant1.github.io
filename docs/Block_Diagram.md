Block Diagram of the Subsystem: Temperature Sensor
The temperature sensor chosen in our project will be LM92CIMX/NOPB from Texas Instruments. It will ensure thermal management and safe operation by shutting down the system if the temerature exceeds safe thresholds. This will help protect the project from thermal runaway or any fire hazards, also detect any component failure that can be caused by abnormal temperature spikes.
