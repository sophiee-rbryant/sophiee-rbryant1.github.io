this project is part of my Spring 2025 Innovation showcase at Arizona State University. Our mission is to design and develop a STEM-themed, interactive, web-enabled device that inspires K-12 students to explore science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). With my background in robotics and embedded systems, I aim to create an engaging and educational experience that sparks curiosity and innovation in young minds.
