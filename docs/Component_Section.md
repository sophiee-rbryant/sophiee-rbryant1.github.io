# My Role
My role on this team extends beyond just creating an Overtemperature Protection system for our robotic arm. I'm responsible for designing and implementing a temperature monitoring system that tracks the armâ€™s components. If overheating is detected, the system will automatically shutdown to prevent potential damage and ensure the long-term reliability of the device. In addition to that, I also play a key role in leading team meetings, ensuring effective communication among all members, and making sure that everyone remains aligned on project goals and deadlines. By maintaining clear communication and organization, I help ensure that our team operates efficiently and collaboratively throughout the project
