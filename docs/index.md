# About Me
Sophie's EGR 314 Project

Spring 2025 Innovation Showcase

Welcome everyone! I am Sophie Bryant and I am majoring in Electrical Systems Engineering in hopes to inspire others. Our project, Robotic Arm, is apart of the Spring 2025 Innovation Showcase at Arizona State University and my focus would be on the temperature sensor. Our goal is to design and build an interactive, web-enabled device with a STEM focus, encouraging K-12 students to explore science, technology, engineering, and math.
