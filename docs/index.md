# About Me
Sophie's EGR 314 Project

Spring 2025 Innovation Showcase

Hello everyone! I'm Sophie Bryant, an Electrical Systems Engineering major with a passion for inspiring others through innovation. Our project, the Robotic Arm, is part of the Spring 2025 Innovation Showcase at Arizona State University. My focus is on developing a temperature sensor system to protect the arm from overheating.

Designed with K-12 students in mind, our robotic arm offers a fun, hands-on introduction to robotics, engineering, and programming. Built from lightweight materials and controlled by intuitive joysticks, it teaches how motors create movement and sensors provide feedback. Our goal is to spark curiosity and inspire the next generation to explore science, technology, engineering, and math through an interactive, web-enabled experience.
