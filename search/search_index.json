From there we placed the ESP32-S3-WROOM-1-N4 at the center because it is responsible for all decisions, data processing, and wireless communication. The 9 V battery and LM2575D2T-3.3R4G regulator were placed on the left as the single power path so it is clear that every other block ultimately depends on a regulated 3.3 V rail. The BME280 pressure/temperature/humidity sensor and LM92 temperature sensor are shown on I\u00b2C links into the ESP32 to emphasize that all environmental data flows through a common digital bus. On the right, the 74HC595PW shift register and LED block are connected by SPI / digital-parallel lines to show how the microcontroller expands its outputs to drive multiple visual indicators. Finally, the ESP-NOW cloud in the center-top shows that the same ESP32 both transmits and receives data, tying the remote node into a wider network of wildfire-monitoring stations. This structure directly reflects the product requirements: stable off-grid power, multi-sensor environmental monitoring, wireless early-warning communication, and clear visual feedback for local users.</p>"},{"location":"Component_Section/","title":"Component Section","text":"Solution Pros Cons Link to Product Link to Product Link to Product"},{"location":"Component_Section/#bill-of-materials","title":"Bill of Materials","text":"<p>Team 313 Bill of Materials.xlsx - Sheet1.pdf</p> <p>We used the power budget to estimate our system\u2019s total current draw by listing every active component, pulling its maximum current from the datasheet, and multiplying it by the quantity shown in the BOM.

Pin 4 (GND) connects directly to system ground. Communication with the microcontroller is provided through the SDA (pin 1) and SCL (pin 2) lines, which follow the I\u00b2C protocol.
