I'm Sophie Bryant, an Electrical Systems Engineering major with a passion for inspiring others through innovation. Our project, the Robotic Arm, is part of the Spring 2025 Innovation Showcase at Arizona State University. My focus is on developing a temperature sensor system to protect the arm from overheating.</p> <p>Designed with K-12 students in mind, our robotic arm offers a fun, hands-on introduction to robotics, engineering, and programming. Built from lightweight materials and controlled by intuitive joysticks, it teaches how motors create movement and sensors provide feedback. Our goal is to spark curiosity and inspire the next generation to explore science, technology, engineering, and math through an interactive, web-enabled experience.</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"API/","title":"API","text":"<p>## Message Tables</p> <p>Safety Message Sent to Motor</p> Field Value Byte 1 msg_type Variable Type uint8_t Min Value 0 Max Value 1 Use To make sure the temperature on motor does not overheat <p>Message to LED</p> Field Value Byte 1 LED_set Variable Type uint8_t Min Value 0 Max Value 1 Use To show it is in use"},{"location":"API/#team-uml","title":"Team UML","text":""},{"location":"Bill_of_Materials/","title":"Bill of Materials","text":"<p>This document provides details of the components that are going to be used for the temperature sensor design.</p> <p> BOM PDF</p> <p>Bill of Materials Sophie.xlsx</p>"},{"location":"Block_Diagram/","title":"Block Diagram","text":"<p>Block Diagram of the Subsystem: Temperature Sensor</p> <p>The temperature sensor chosen in our project will be LM92CIMX/NOPB from Texas Instruments.

It helped me identify key areas for improvement, particularly in power management, communication interfaces, and debugging capabilities. To enhance the system\u2019s reliability and compatibility, I included a 9V wall adapter as the main power source. This input voltage is regulated down to 3.3V using a switching voltage regulator to power the temperature sensor and microcontroller. Connecting the LM92 temperature sensor to the PIC18F47Q10 microcontroller using the I\u00b2C protocol, helping to provide accurate and consistent data transmission. Additionally, I added more of the debugging LEDs on the board. Not only did it help provide real-time visual feedback during testing and troubleshooting but it also gave me the flexibility to incorporate additional indicators for future system enhancements. These modifications collectively improved the overall functionality, maintainability, and adaptability of my subsystem.</p>"},{"location":"Component_Section/","title":"Component Section","text":"Solution Pros Cons Link to Product Link to Product Link to Product"},{"location":"Component_Section/#bill-of-materials","title":"Bill of Materials","text":"<p>Team 313 Bill of Materials.xlsx - Sheet1.pdf</p> <p>We used the power budget to estimate our system\u2019s total current draw by listing every active component, pulling its maximum current from the datasheet, and multiplying it by the quantity shown in the BOM. By assuming worst-case conditions, ESP32 transmitting, all sensors active, and all LEDs on. We created a conservative estimate rather than relying on typical values.

Pin 4 (GND) connects directly to system ground. Communication with the microcontroller is provided through the SDA (pin 1) and SCL (pin 2) lines, which follow the I\u00b2C protocol. The LM92 uses open drain outputs, each line is pulled up to 3.3V using 10K resistors (R1 and R2) to ensure proper behavior. Which these lines connect to the system I\u00b2C bus.

The PIC microcontroller can be programmed to control motor drivers through digital signals while monitoring temperature data from the temp sensor via I\u00b2C. The existing UART daisy chain headers provide a convenient interface for connecting the ESP32, which enables wireless communication through Wi-Fi. In this configuration, the ESP32 can issue control commands to the PIC or directly interface with the motor driver for real-time motion control.

Adding a motor control, wireless communication, and power management would help improve it as well. First, a motor driver should be added to control motors, with digital signals provided from the microcontroller pins. The motors would enable movement of the robotic arm\u2019s joints while ensuring safe motor operation through the use of protective components. Additionally, integrating an ESP32 module would introduce wireless control via Wi-Fi, connected through UART or I\u00b2C for communication with the PIC microcontroller. To help the higher current of motors, a dedicated 5V regulator should be included to power the motors independently from the 3.3V, helping to prevent voltage drops and system instability. It is also recommended to incorporate system feedback components such as limit switches, encoders to improve control precision and ensure safe operation. The temperature sensor can be utilized to implement temperature protection by disabling motors if the temperature overheats. These would help collectively transform the current subsystem into a robust and responsive platform capable of driving and monitoring a functional robotic arm.</p>"},{"location":"pic-table/","title":"PIC Table","text":""},{"location":"pic-table/#image-of-pic","title":"Image of PIC","text":"ESP Info Answer Model PIC18F47Q10-E/PT Product Page URL Link to product Datasheet URL(s) Link to datasheet Application Notes URL(s) Link to Application Notes Vendor link Link to Vendor Code Examples Link to GitHUb Microchip MPLAB Harmony Unit cost $1.64 Absolute Maximum Current for entire IC 300mA Supply Voltage Range 1.8V to 5.5V Absolute Maximum current  (for entire IC) 300mA Maximum GPIO current  (per pin) 50mA Supports External Interrupts?
